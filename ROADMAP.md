# Roadmap

What's planned for Qx, by release version. Released versions and the
changes they shipped live in [`CHANGELOG.md`](CHANGELOG.md) — shipped
milestone sections are removed from this file once they're on Hex.

Last updated: 2026-07-13. v0.11 (API Review Follow-Through) is
complete — its scope moved to `CHANGELOG.md` for the 0.11.0 release,
per the shipped-milestone convention above. Next up: simulation
refactor & performance (v0.12), visualization & hardware (v0.13),
with noise and algorithms in v0.14/v0.15. The API
consistency review's yardstick is `spec/api-design-principles.md`; its
findings and triage buckets are in
`.claude/plans/api-consistency-review/findings.md`.

## v0.12: Simulation Refactor & Performance

The 2026-06-14 audit's simulation-engine refactor and performance
work: clarify the Calc / CalcFast split, kill the host-side loops.
Additive and internal, no breaking changes.

- [ ] Replace case dispatch with gate registry in apply_instruction (qx-agu)
- [ ] Convert case gate_name dispatch to multi-clause functions in Simulation (qx-dn2)
- [ ] Clarify or merge Calc module responsibility with CalcFast (qx-rut)
- [ ] Reshape `Qx.CalcFast` kernels to eliminate `Nx.take` gather + `Nx.select` mask: single-qubit (`lib/qx/calc_fast.ex:67–91`), CNOT (`114–143`), CSWAP (`157–185`), Toffoli (`187–229`). Replace with reshape + 2×2 tensor contraction along the qubit axis. Highest-leverage perf change in the audit; depends on the v0.8.1 tolerance widening (audit: perf CRIT C1/C2; Iron Law #3)
- [ ] Vectorise measurement probability and state collapse: `lib/qx/simulation.ex` host loop `for i <- 0..(2^n - 1), Nx.to_number(state[i])` runs once per shot (~1 M host syncs at 1024 shots × n=10) (audit: perf CRIT C3; Iron Law #5)
- [ ] Replace `2^n × 2^n` matrix materialisation in SWAP / iSWAP / CP / CY / CRx / CRy / CRz: `lib/qx/simulation.ex` + the host-loop matrix builders in `lib/qx/gates.ex`. Currently OOM above n≈10 (4.3 GB at n=14) (audit: perf HIGH)
- [ ] Replace host-side `2^n` Elixir-list construction in `Qx.StateInit` and in `Qx.ResultBuilder.build_probability_tensor` (`List.replace_at` over 2^n list). Scope to whatever survives the v0.11 StateInit/Math tier decision — don't optimise functions being deprecated (audit: perf HIGH; Iron Law #5)
- [ ] Vectorise sample generation: `Enum.scan` cumulative distribution + per-shot `Enum.find_index` linear scan is O(shots × 2^n); 100M+ host iterations at 100k shots × n=10 (audit: perf HIGH)
- [ ] Cap retained state in `run_with_conditionals`: materialises the full list of `{state, cbits}` for every shot before `Enum.frequencies`; at 100k shots × n=20 holds ~1.6 TB resident before reduce (audit: perf HIGH)
- [ ] Replace `instructions ++ [new]` quadratic append in `Qx.QuantumCircuit` with prepend + reverse-on-finalise (audit: perf HIGH; also flagged by `usage_rules.elixir`)
- [ ] Cap or auto-truncate state-sized rendering above n≈12 qubits, raising a typed `Qx.*Error` instead: the three VegaLite chart builders (`lib/qx/draw/vega_lite.ex`), the histogram data build in `lib/qx/draw.ex`, and the 2^n-row table build in `Qx.Draw.Tables`. Rescoped 2026-07-05: the unbounded SVG chart renderer named by the audit was deleted in the v0.10 Draw rework, which shrank this item (audit: perf CRIT C4)
- [ ] Replace `:math.pow(2, n) |> trunc/1` with `Integer.pow(2, n)` (or `Bitwise.bsl(1, n)`) across `state_init.ex`, `quantum_circuit.ex`, `simulation.ex`, `gates.ex`, `validation.ex`. Exact integer math (audit: perf LOW)
- [ ] Break the 4-module cycle `tables → register → qubit → draw → tables`: anchored by the internal calc engine's `Qx.Qubit.draw_bloch/2` defdelegating up to `Qx.Draw` and `Qx.Draw.Tables.render/2` pattern-matching `%Qx.Register{}`. Both anchors survived the v0.10 demotion (the modules are hidden, not gone); the cycle dissolves for free if the 1.0 calc-engine removal lands first — sequence accordingly (audit: arch MED)
- [ ] Performance benchmarks published and tracked across releases (Benchee baseline `mix bench` exists; results to be published once GPU acceleration via EXLA/EMLX is exercised)

---

## v0.13: Visualization & Hardware

Polish the Bloch renderer, broaden hardware support beyond IBM.

- [ ] Improve Bloch sphere SVG visual quality (qx-w93). Raised stakes since v0.10: the SVG renderer is now the *only* Bloch path (the VegaLite projection was deleted in the Draw rework) and ships as the `Qx.Draw.Image` artifact rendered inline in Livebook
- [ ] Support for running on AWS Braket QPUs (moved from v0.7)

---

## v0.14: Noise & Realism

- [ ] Noise models for simulating real-hardware decoherence (bit-flip, phase-flip, depolarising)
- [ ] Density matrix simulation as an alternative to statevector
- [ ] Circuit optimisation / gate cancellation pass
- [ ] Mid-circuit reset operation `Qx.reset/2`: QAAL `MzReset q` parity; first-class in OpenQASM 3 / IBM hardware. Needs new `:reset` instruction handler in `Qx.Simulation` (projection-and-relabel) — mind Iron Law #9's producer/dispatch pairing when adding the instruction kind. The name becomes clean once v0.11 deprecates `QuantumCircuit.reset/1` (plan: tbd, see qaal-analysis A3)

---

## v0.15: Algorithms & Building Blocks

Governed by `spec/api-design-principles.md` §8: building blocks are
appenders with the gate shape `(circuit, args...) -> circuit`,
composing existing operations only, one facade module per domain. The
v0.11 appender work (`bell_pair`/`ghz`) sets the template. Learner
tutorial content lives in qxportal; what belongs here is the library
surface those tutorials call.

- [ ] `Qx.Oracle`: standard oracle constructors (bit-string/BV oracles, phase oracles, truth-table compilation) so algorithm examples stop hand-rolling CNOT loops. Needs its own design doc before code
- [ ] Algorithm components as appenders: Grover diffusion, QFT, phase estimation
- [ ] Grow toward a complete algorithm library covering the canonical textbook algorithms (QPE, VQE, Shor's ingredients), with matching tutorial content added on the portal
- [ ] Quantum error correction building blocks + a portal tutorial (repetition code)

---

## Backlog / Under Consideration

These have no commitment and no scheduled version. They may move up, move down, or be dropped.

- [ ] Second instruction-producer surface: `lib/qx/export/openqasm/lowering.ex`
  builds `{:measure,…}`/`{:barrier,…}`/`{:c_if,…}`/gate tuples directly on its
  raw lowering-state map (QASM import bulk-builds an instructions list, then
  wraps it in a `QuantumCircuit`), bypassing the `QuantumCircuit.add_*` producer
  surface centralized in `feat/producer-hygiene`. Iron Law #9-adjacent. At
  minimum add a moduledoc caveat; ideally a shared shape-constructor both paths
  use. Surfaced by the producer-hygiene merge-gate review (2026-07-12).
- [ ] Fix the 5 pre-existing broken `Qx.Operations` doctests currently excluded
  via `:except` in `test/qx/operations_test.exs` (`tap_circuit/2`, `tap_state/2`,
  `tap_probabilities/2`, `c_if/4` — they rely on `IO.inspect`/`IO.puts`
  side-output + `%Qx.QuantumCircuit{...}` ellipsis that never validated). Rewrite
  as valid doctests, then remove from the `:except` list. Surfaced by wiring
  `doctest Qx.Operations` in `feat/qasm-facade-tdg`.
- [ ] Fix (or dialyzer-ignore with justification) the 70 `mix dialyzer`
  warnings surfaced when `dialyxir` was wired into `mix.exs` on 2026-07-19.
  Root cause: `Nx.Type.t()` (`deps/nx/lib/nx/type.ex`) is typed as only the
  canonical tuple form (e.g. `{:c, 64}`), not the atom shorthand (`:c64`);
  Qx's own `@spec`s reuse `Nx.Type.t()` for params that are documented and
  tested with `:c64` (default arg in `Qx.StateInit.basis_state/3` and
  everything that calls it — `Register.new/1`, `Qubit.new/0,1`,
  `Qx.create_circuit/1,2`, `Qx.Patterns.*`, etc.), so Dialyzer sees an
  unsatisfiable contract and cascades "no local return" up the call chain.
  Runtime is correct (`Nx.Type.normalize!/1` accepts the shorthand; all 1405
  tests pass) — this is a typespec/tooling mismatch, not a logic bug. A
  handful of unrelated findings are mixed in: unknown types
  `Qx.Hardware.ConfigError.t/0` / `Qx.Hardware.NoMeasurementsError.t/0`
  (missing `@type t` in those exception modules), two `pattern_match`
  warnings in `lib/qx/hardware/ibm.ex:416,428` worth a real look, and 5
  harmless `unused_fun` clauses in the generated OpenQASM parser
  (`lib/qx/export/openqasm/parser.ex`).

- Stream the IBM `/results` body via Req `into:` with a size cap that aborts
  over ~50 MB (real OOM/DoS protection). Deferred from `ibm-client-hardening`:
  without the cap, plain streaming saves little (the Sampler result is still
  JSON-parsed to an in-memory map) and the source (IBM Quantum) is trusted.
  Revisit if result sizes or the threat model change.
- Interactive step-through widget: scrub through a circuit drawing while
  phase circles (Quirk-style amplitude disks) update per step. Piece 1 of 3
  shipped in v0.10 (`Qx.steps/2` with `seed:` gives a scrubbable consistent
  trajectory). Remaining: (2) a phase-circle renderer in `Qx.Draw` returning
  a `Qx.Draw.Image` per the v0.10 artifact pattern (settle the global-phase
  convention), plus gate-position metadata from the circuit renderer so the
  highlight can sync with `step.index`; (3) the interactive Kino widget in
  `kino_qx`, consuming the published Qx release (workspace §4). The renderer
  fits the v0.13 visualization theme if pulled forward.
- Symbolic / algebraic simulation (exact fractions, no floating point)
- Circuit-level visualization improvements (multi-qubit gate boxes, measurement symbols)
- Cirq circuit import adapter (Qiskit/IBM Quantum import already covered by OpenQASM 3.0)
- Multi-register `Qx.QuantumCircuit` (current model is a single quantum + single classical
  register; OpenQASM import currently rejects multi-register programs)
- Named circuit-mode register views: bind a name to a qubit-index list so
  `Qx.h_all(qc, alice)` reads like QAAL `H alice`. Stashed from `qaal-analysis`
  (A4). The naming collision with calc-mode `Qx.Register` softened when the
  calc engine went internal in v0.10, but the API-surface cost still stands
  and B1 (list/range overloads, v0.8) covers ~80% of the value. Revisit when
  multi-register tutorials (Shor / QPE) start feeling unmanageable.
- `else` branches on `c_if` conditionals (currently raises on import; rewrite as two ifs)
- WASM / browser-side simulation for LiveBook embedding
- A 1.0 release and an API-stability guarantee (no breaking changes without a
  major bump). Since the 2026-07-04 API consistency review this has a concrete
  gate list (the "breaking-1.0" bucket in
  `.claude/plans/api-consistency-review/findings.md`): calc-engine removal,
  `QuantumCircuit` state-field extraction (initial state becomes a `run`
  option), the `measure`/`measure_z` final pick, StateInit survivor
  naming/opts, `most_frequent` → `nil` on empty, conditional-run ensemble
  semantics, plus executing the v0.11 deprecation removals. Still
  deliberately unscheduled; the list is the entry criteria, not a date.

## Out of Scope (for now)

These are explicitly not planned, to set honest expectations:

- **Full fault-tolerant simulation**: the memory requirements make this impractical at the qubit
  counts Qx targets
- **Hardware control / pulse-level scheduling**: IBM Quantum handles the hardware layer; Qx stays at
  the circuit abstraction level
- **Classical co-processing / hybrid workflows beyond conditional gates**: out of scope until the
  core simulation story is complete
